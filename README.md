# Power BI Portfolio

This project is an interactive sales dashboard created in Power BI using an online retail dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes various sales metrics, such as product categories, regions, and customer payment methods. This dashboard visualizes key metrics like total revenue, units sold, and customer count, broken down by month and category. Interactive filters allow for regional insights, while visualizations like pie, line, and bar charts reveal sales trends, revenue distribution, and payment preferences, providing comprehensive insights into sales performance.
