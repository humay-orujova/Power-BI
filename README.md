# Power BI Portfolio Project

### Project Overview

This project involves developing an interactive Power BI dashboard using an online retail dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to analyze sales trends, understand seasonal patterns, and provide data-driven insights into the performance of the company across different regions, product categories, and customer preferences.

### Data source

[Online Sales Dataset - Popular Marketplace Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data/data): This dataset includes details on product categories, sales revenue, units sold, regions, and customer payment methods.

### Tools

- Power Query (Power BI) - Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Power BI - Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

Key data preparation steps included:
1. Importing data into Power Query for initial inspection
2. Checking for duplicates and errors to ensure data integrity before analysis.
3. Transforming and formatting data to make it suitable for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In the analysis phase, I explored the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Which products have the highest sales volume and which generate the most revenue, revealing differences between best-sellers by volume and revenue?
- How do sales fluctuate seasonally for each product category and overall revenue throughout the 8 month?
- What are the regional sales trends, as revealed by interactive slicers?

### Results/Findings

Key findings from the analysis:

- Sales volume and revenue sources differ: some top-selling products donâ€™t necessarily bring in the highest revenue.
- Seasonal patterns reveal peak sales for certain categories in specific months, which helps identify high-demand periods.
- Each region has a prioritized product, which directly influences the revenue generated from that region.

### Recommendations

Based on these findings:

- Prioritize inventory and marketing for high-revenue products during peak demand months.
- Tailor marketing strategies to suit regional product preferences, leveraging seasonal trends to maximize sales in different areas.
